Nxt Talks Website Clone 🎧

This is a partial clone of the Nxt Talks website, created as part of an internship assignment. The goal was to replicate the structure and styling of the original site using only HTML, CSS, and a bit of Bootstrap. While about 70% of the layout stays true to the original design, some parts have been modified where replication wasn’t feasible.

🔍 About the Project
This is my first ever full-page project, and it was both challenging and rewarding. Up until this, I had only worked on small snippets and components — so handling multiple sections, classes, and styles all together was overwhelming at first. But I pushed through, and in the process, gained a much deeper understanding of frontend development.
